Made a proof of concept to use HashiCorp's Vault with SpringBoot. You can create, update and read from your Key Value (KV) store programatically.

Lets get started with installation on mac.

Firstly lets install vault with the following command.
```brew install vault```

Moving ahead with vault setup.
